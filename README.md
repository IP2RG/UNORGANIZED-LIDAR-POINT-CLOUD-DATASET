# UNORGANIZED-LIDAR-POINT-CLOUD-DATASET
The dataset includes 300 LiDAR point cloud frames collected from three urban road types: flat, crowned, and traffic-interfered. Each frame has ~35,000 points, captured using our LUKUN_MLS system. This diverse dataset supports robust pavement plane fitting evaluation. See our paper for details.
